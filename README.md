# Friend-Finder

## Purpose
The purpose of the app was for me to continue to develop my skills with NodeJS by using Express. 

## How to use
You can find the app by following the link to the deployed version on Heroku.

Initial start of the page has a navigation button to the survey. 

On the survey the user will input their information beginning with their name and a link to their profile photos.

The user then must answer a series of questions on a scale of 1 to 5.

Utilizing jQuery and Express, the app will pull in the values the user has input. It will calculate the total value of the user input. 

By comparing the calculated total to the total values of other user inputs a new friend will be determined. The new friends name and profile photo will be displayed on the screen.
